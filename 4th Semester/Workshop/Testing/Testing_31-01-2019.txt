TESTING :

--> In order to make sure that the application is working according to customer requirement we have to perform testing.

AUTOMATION :

--> Performing any task using a tool or a machine is called automation

Advantages :
- Saves Time
- Faster
- Less resources
- Restless
- Multi task

Disadvantages :
- Initial investment is more
- Usually used for long term projects
- Requires additional skills set
- Constant maintenance


--> Testing the functionalities of an application tool using automated tools is called automation testing.


SELENIUM :

--> Selenium is a FREE and OPEN SOURCE automation tool which is used to automate WEB BASED applications.

Advantages :
- Free
- Open Source
- Can automate web based applications such as Facebook, Gmail, Flipkart, etc.,
- Supports 14 different programming languages like Java, C#, Ruby, Python, etc.,
- Supports multiple platforms like Windows, Linux and Mac OS
- It can be run on all the browsers like Chrome, Firefox, etc.,

Architecture :
Language binding <--> Web driver(API) <--> Driver executable files <--> Browsers

Java Selenium Architecture :
--> Methods of Search Context Interface :
- findElement()
- findElements()

--> Methods of Web Driver Interface :
- get()
- getTitle()
- getCurrentUrl()
- getPageSource()
- findElement()
- findElements()
- getWindowHandle()
- getWindowHandles()
- switchTo()
- manage()
- navigate()
- close()
- quit()

--> Methods of Take Screenshot Interface :
- getScreenShotAs()

--> Methods of Javascript Executor :
- executeScript()
- executeAsyncScript()

--> Steps to install Selenium :
- Download the selenium jar file and the driver executable files from the website : https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
- Extract all the driver executable files
- In eclipse create a new java project with some name
- Under the java project create 2 folders with the names drivers and jars
- Store all the extracted driver executable files under drivers folder
- Store the Selenium jar file under jars folder
- Associate the jar file with current java project
    To associate the jar file with java project :
    - Expand jars folder
    - Right click on the jar file
    - Go to build path
    - Click on Add to Build Path


--> Before performing action on any elements we have to perform the following steps :
- Inspect the element
- Identify/Locate the element
- Find the element
- Perform the action

- Inspect the element :
    In order to inspect the element :
    - Right click on the element
    - Click on the Inspect element option which will return the source code of that element
    --> Note : For security purpose in some of the applications right click option will be disabled,
           In such cases to inspect the element :
           - Press F12
           - Click on inspect element icon
           - Click on the element present on the web page

--> Locators (very important in Selenium) :
- Locators are the static methods which are used to identify the elements which are present on the web page.
- All these locators are present in a class called "By" which is an abstract class
- There are 8 types of locators and all types of locators takes a single argument of type string.
- The different types of locators are :
1) id(str)
2) name(str)
3) className(str)
4) tagName(str)
5) linkText(str)
6) partialLinkText(str)
7) cssSelector(str)
8) xPath(str)

--> Note : Out of all the locators id(), name() and className() are available as attributes of an element.

--> Note : 
- To handle the single element we use findElement() method
- In findElement() if the specified locator is not matching with any elements then it will throw NoSuchElement exception
- In findElement() if the specified locator is matching with multiple elements then is returns the address of the first matching element
- If the specified element is a link then we can identify that element by using locator linkText()
- If the link is partially dynamic then we can identify that element by using partialLinkText()
