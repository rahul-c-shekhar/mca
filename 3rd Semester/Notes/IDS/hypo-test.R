#Question1: Suppose the manufacturer claims that the mean lifetime of a light bulb is more than 10,000 hours. 
#In a sample of 30 light bulbs, it was found that they only last 9,900 hours on average. 
#Assume the population standard deviation is 120 hours. At .05 significance level, can we reject the claim by the manufacturer?
